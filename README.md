 Second game for studying Unity

Move with Arrow keys, and Jump with Z key. (Can double jump too)

So, this is more of a game!

An arcade game, with randomization and difficulty scale.
The score system is also there,
but as I haven't learned Unity's UI yet so it's using
Instantiate to display scores.

(Yes, in theory, I could draw 0~9 number sprites and display them with Instantiate,
but drawing all digits is tedious (also didn't occur to me back then))
